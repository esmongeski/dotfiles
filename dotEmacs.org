* Package things!
This is a bit of fumbling to try and get this all to work on a new computer from zero with minimal manual intervention.

The key is package-refresh-contents - however, it's super slow. The t argument makes it run asynchronously. This means I might have to open emacs multiple times on a new computer to get this working.

Apparently the call to package-initialize isn't always required? I don't fully understand what it does yet.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
  ;;(package-initialize)
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-refresh-contents)

#+END_SRC

Ubuntu specific (hopefully this doesn't break mac!) - this forces org to update to a later version.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

This brings back the old "<s" shortcut for source blocks. Unfortunately it has different casing than before, but that's not worth the time to fix (probably easy though).

* Custom variables (I don't really remember what this is)
Variables - org agenda files, which will some day pull dates, but are also used for how things refile. Packages, which I guess says which packages are installed?

* Todo customization - states and donetime/note
Ongoing thing to figure out what states I want. log-done enables timestamp and prompts for a note. Archive location is what you'd expect.

More details [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-TODO-state-changes.html][Here]]
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-todo-keywords
        '((sequence "TODO(t)" "SOMEDAY(s)" "WAITING(w)" "IN-PROGRESS(i)" "|" "DONE(d)" "EXPORTED(e)" "OBSOLOTE(b)")))

  (setq org-log-done 'time)
  (setq org-log-done 'note)

  (setq org-archive-location "~/Dropbox/org/archive.org::")
#+END_SRC

Custom priorities
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-lowest-priority 74)
#+END_SRC

Make checkbox/todo tracking recursive so I see everything under the subtree
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Column view in org-agenda
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-columns-default-format-for-agenda "%80ITEM(Task) %4PRIORITY(Priority)  %10TODO(Todo Status) %17Effort(Estimated Effort){:} %CLOCKSUM(Time Spent)")
#+end_src
** Agenda Sorting
Define a custom tiebreaker for priority - I basically want A on par with within 1 day, B on par with within 2 days, etc.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (setq org-agenda-cmp-user-defined (lambda (a b) (message (org-get-priority a))))
#+end_src

Only one change from the default strategy, which is to use effort-up. The ordering on agenda is now "high priority first, low effort first, respect order of org-agenda-files".
I think the fact that all my things in "recurring.org" are habits sort of circuvents "habit-down". But I don't mind for now.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-sorting-strategy
        '((agenda user-defined-up todo-state-down habit-down time-up priority-down effort-up category-keep)
          (todo priority-down category-keep)
          (tags priority-down category-keep)
          (search category-keep)))
#+end_src
** Curating todos
Org agenda todo - filter out things with dates so I schedule any dangling todos. Apparently I need all of these set - I tend to just slap dates on stuff so it'll show on the agenda,
which is good enough for me.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled "all")
  (setq org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines "all")

                            :todo ("TODO" "IN-PROGRESS" "WAITING" "SOMEDAY")))
          ;; After the last group, the agenda will display items that didn't

          (:name "Future Habits"

          (:name "Done"

* Custom Key Bindings
This first one is to get a different one for org-refile. I want it as C-r C-f (rf -> refile)

First thing to do is to set "C-r" as a possible prefix.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-prefix-command 'ring-map)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-r") 'ring-map)
#+END_SRC

Next thing to do is to remove "C-r" from the evil map (apparently it's redo, which I never use).

Then we do the actual "C-r C-f" bind.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "C-r") nil)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-r C-f") 'org-refile)

#+END_SRC

Another one - archive. I'm gonna do "C-r C-a" for "refile - archive", and because I have "C-r" as a prefix now.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-r C-a") 'org-archive-subtree)
#+END_SRC

* Debugging
Trying to see what this does on startup so I can optimize my init/dotfiles.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;;(setq message-log-max t)
#+end_src

* IN-PROGRESS Notion
This is an attempt to hit the [[https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started][notion api]] in order to dump tasks out of org into notion.

My anticipated workflow is, while grooming my inbox, instead of refiling an item, I export it to Notion via POST.

Then I mark the item EXPORTED (custom TODO state) and archive it.

This is also the first elisp I'm writing on my own, so it's a learning experience.

Thus far I've managed to extract the todo state and map it to the todo status I use in notion.

Next, I need to format a payload with local secrets (api key) and hit the api. It looks like the preferred way to do this in emacs is [[http://tkf.github.io/emacs-request/][request.el]].
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-element)
  ;; make a function that gets the org heading components as an alist mapped to the things in notion
  ;; make a function that json encodes that
  ;; make a function to call the api
  (defun org-todo-to-notion-todo (org-todo)
    "map org todo status to notion status - you should change this to fit whatever todo statuses you have"
    (plist-get '(TODO "To Do" IN-PROGRESSS "Doing" DONE "Done") (intern org-todo)))

  (defun org-heading-to-notion-json ()
    "Encode current heading as json"
    (let* ((ohc (org-heading-components))
           (todo-state (nth 2 ohc))
           (notion-todo-state (org-todo-to-notion-todo todo-state)))
      (message notion-todo-state)))

#+end_src

          ("w" "Work" entry (file "~/Dropbox/org/workStuff.org")
           "* TODO %?\n")
          ("t" "Things on my mind" entry (file "~/Dropbox/org/tList.org")
           "* TODO %?\n" )
          ("s" "Stuff" entry (file "~/Dropbox/org/stuff.org")

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src
* Ubuntu
This is a hack because I probably have a bad config on my ubuntu machine. For some reason, ~string-empty-p~ isn't defined at runtime, but when I ~describe-function~ it, it shows up.
This breaks org-agenda. Requring ~subr-x~ at startup fixes this.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'subr-x)
#+end_src
Ubuntu specific (hopefully this doesn't break mac!) - this forces org to update to a later version.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org :ensure org-plus-contrib :pin org)
#+END_SRC
More hacks to force dependencies into place, hopefully.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-macs)
#+end_src
* ODT Styles
The default styles are gross. I use google docs all day erry day. This is an ODT file that has the headers for google docs.

This seems to barf on multiline source blocks, but I don't use that for notes much, so that's ok (typically the last line
of a source block is unstyled).
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-odt-styles-file (concat (getenv "PATH_TO_DOTFILES_REPO") "/gdocStyles.odt"))
#+end_src
Table of contents is ugly, and google doc styles do it for you anyway (in google docs)
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-export-with-toc nil)
#+end_src

So this is an attempt to make people in a meeting todos, and then use todos to quickly flag who is speaking
as I'm taking notes. You can only do todo states on headers by default, so I'm using inlinetask to try and
use todo states elsewhere.

Update: Doesn't quite work the way I want, it renders kinda ugly in a huge block. If I'm indented far enough (5?)
the todo states seem to work. Keeping because this is needed for the meeting minutes stuff below.

Update: four *s seems to work to not use a header, which will work for me.

*** Daily linking
Workflow to link things from agenda to daily note to more intentionally curate todo list.

**** Get daily agenda
This doesn't quite seem to work yet - I suspect it doesn't play nice with
super agenda
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
               '(("d" "Daily schedule"
                ((agenda ""
                         ((org-agenda-span 'day)
                          (org-agenda-use-time-grid nil)
                          (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline))))))))
  (defun as/get-daily-agenda (&optional date)
    "Return the agenda for the day as a string."
    (interactive)
    (let ((file (make-temp-file "daily-agenda" nil ".txt")))
      (org-agenda nil "d" nil)
      (when date (org-agenda-goto-date date))
      (org-agenda-write file nil nil "*Org Agenda*")
      (kill-buffer)
      (with-temp-buffer
        (insert-file-contents file)
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (kill-line 2)
        (while (re-search-forward "^  " nil t)
          (replace-match "- " nil nil))
        (buffer-string))))

**** Daily capture templates
This is the bit referenced above that inserts the target header as
a link into the org roam note. Pretty handy!
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
        (let ((head
               (concat "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d (%A)>\n#+startup: showall\n* Daily Overview\n"
                       "#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value raw\n"
                       "(as/get-daily-agenda \"%<%Y-%m-%d>\")\n"
                       "#+end_src\n"
                       "* [/] Do Today\n* [/] Maybe Do Today\n* Journal\n")))
          `(("j" "journal" entry
             "* %<%H:%M> %?"
             :if-new (file+head+olp "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" ,head ("Journal")))
            ("t" "do today" item
             "[ ] %a"
             :if-new (file+head+olp "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" ,head ("Do Today"))
             :immediate-finish t)
            ("m" "maybe do today" item
             "[ ] %a"
             :if-new (file+head+olp "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" ,head ("Maybe Do Today"))
             :immediate-finish t))))

#+end_src
Make a shortcut in org agenda to cap something.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd "c") 'org-roam-dailies-capture-today)
#+end_src
* More agenda customization
I'll admit, there's a header further up for this, but for some reason defining this that far up breaks, and I don't really want
to figure out why =org-agenda-mode-map= isn't initiatlized up [[file:dotEmacs.org::149][here]]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd "C-w C-w") 'evil-window-next)
#+end_src
* Rifle
All the other deps with the funked up deps
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package f)
  (use-package s)
  (use-package dash)
  (use-package helm-org-rifle)
#+end_src
Nice little shortcut for evil mode for rifle.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key evil-ex-map "rf" 'helm-org-rifle-agenda-files)
#+end_src
