This is all vim shortcuts that work in evil mode
* Windows
:sp - open horizontal split

:vp - open vertical split

C-w w - cycle next window

C-w W - cycle previous window

Doesn't look like this works when an emacs buffer (i.e. org-agenda) is open - except I sorta fixed it, although it doesn't work on agenda headings yet.

C-w C-s - split horizontally
C-w C-v - split vertically
* org-evil shortcuts
